\section{Behavior Cloning}

Behavior Cloning is the simplest form of Imitation Learning, where the agent learns a policy by treating the problem as a supervised learning task rather than a trial-and-error reinforcement challenge. In this approach, an expert provides a dataset of demonstrations consisting of specific state-action pairs ~(s,a)~, and the agent is trained to learn a mapping function (policy) that mimics the expert's actions given the same states.

Unlike standard Reinforcement Learning, Behavior Cloning does not require a complex reward function or active exploration of the environment during training. Instead, the agent simply minimizes a loss function to replicate the expert's decisions.
